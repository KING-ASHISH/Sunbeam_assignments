# Sunbeam_assignments

Hey guys. This is the assignments repo of Sunbeam DAC Students. 

1. If you are added as a collaborator, you should add a folder by you name and inside that you can use to upload your answers to the assignments and then link those for others to see and help you.
2. This would be easier way to share and edit code between us. 
3. If there is any problem you can ask in the #git-github text channel of our discord server. 

âœŒðŸ˜„ Suggestions Welcome.
